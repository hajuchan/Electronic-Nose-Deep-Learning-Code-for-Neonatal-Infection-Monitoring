Published in: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2025.138376


## üî¨ Research Overview
This study develops a non-invasive electronic nose system for real-time infection monitoring in neonatal incubators by identifying pathogens through microbial volatile organic compounds (mVOCs). 

The system can distinguish between:

- Gram-positive bacteria: S. aureus, S. epidermidis
- Gram-negative bacteria: E. coli, K. pneumoniae
- Fungi: C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis

## üèÜ Key Results

97% accuracy in laboratory conditions using LSTM model
85.4% accuracy in real-size incubator (155L) testing
Superior performance over traditional diagnostic methods

## üß† Deep Learning Models
**Primary Models**

- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) - Best performance (97% accuracy)
- CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) - 92% accuracy
- LSTM-FCN (LSTM-Fully Convolutional Networks) - Multivariate time-series classification

**Baseline Models**

- SVM (Support Vector Machine)
- Decision Tree
- Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression

## Transfer Learning

TL-ResNet50 - Pre-trained on ImageNet, fine-tuned for pathogen classification

## üìä Dataset Specifications
**Sensor Array**

9 metal oxide sensors (TGS series, MQ series)
9 mVOC chemicals for pathogen identification
Time-series data with 2-second intervals over 60 seconds

## Target VOCs

Common to all pathogens: Ethanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, Acetic acid
Bacterial markers: Formaldehyde, Indole, 2-undecanone
Fungal markers: 3-octanone, Isobutyl acetate, Cyclohexanone

## üõ† Implementation Details
**Data Preprocessing**
```
# python Baseline correction and normalization
normalized_response = V / V0  # V0: baseline voltage, V: response voltage

# Train-test split
train_data = 80%
test_data = 20%

# Zero-padding for sequence length matching
sequence_length = 60_seconds / 2_second_intervals = 30_timesteps
```

**LSTM Architecture**
- **Input**: Multivariate time-series (9 sensors √ó 30 timesteps)
Memory cells for long-term dependencies
Output: 7-class classification (pathogen types)
Optimization: Grid-search for hyperparameters

**Performance Metrics**

- **Accuracy**: 97% (laboratory), 85.4% (real incubator)
- **AUC-ROC**: >0.95 for all pathogens
- **R¬≤ values**: >0.80 for pathogen quantification
